# Tumor-Classifier

Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), this project aims to use Machine Learning to create a Linear Classifier to determine whether a tumor sample is Benign or Malignant.

The data is from a cell nucleus with the following real-valued features, with a label of M = Malignant or B = Benign.
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
c) perimeter 
d) area 
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
